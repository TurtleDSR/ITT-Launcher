This is the It Takes Two mod launcher app.

Requires Java 11+ to run, should warn you if you try to launch it with any lower version.
Currently only supports the Steam build of the game, I will possibly add EA support in the future. (Console is off the table)

If you have any issues running message me on discord @TurtleDSR
